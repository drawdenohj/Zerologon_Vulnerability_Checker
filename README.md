Zerologon Vulnerability Checker
Zerologon Vulnerability Checker
The Zerologon Vulnerability Checker is a Python script that checks if a Windows domain controller is vulnerable to the Zerologon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472). The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the authentication process and gain administrative access to the domain controller.

Requirements

  Python 3.x
  socket
  struct

Usage

  Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/drawdenohj/Zerologon_Vulnerability_Checker.git
  Navigate to the script directory: cd zerologon-checker
  Run the script: python3 zerologon-checker.py
  Enter the IP address and hostname of the domain controller when prompted.

Output
  The script will output whether the domain controller is vulnerable or not. For example:


    Enter the IP address of the domain controller: 192.168.1.10
    Enter the hostname of the domain controller: DC1

    DC1 is vulnerable to Zerologon!
